## About Me

I have a degree in Public Administration, I worked in the area, but if there's one thing I've discovered, it's that I have the vocation to develop software - and dreams too - in addition to communicating.

Today I work in application development, an experience that started in earnest in 2019, and I also enjoy learning and teaching. In addition to writing on websites and blogs (and there are three, well segmented: a personal one, a musical one and a tech one), I have just over 1000 followers in the three largest social networks.

I also have knowledge in two more languages: English and French, and I aim, in addition to continuing to improve myself, to be able to teach people who are curious and willing to get to know this so rich area that is technology.
